# Mindcomplete: AI Writing Partner

**AI that writes WITH you, not for you.**

That was the main idea behind this tool. You just start writing, and Mindcomplete continues for you when you stop.

Instead of acting based on prompts, it analyzes what you have written, along with selected text and images, to understand exactly what you're working on.

Powered with Google's Gemini, it uses the same smart AI, but at this time, it's not on top of your mind, but it's a natural extension to your thoughts.

### 🚀 Why Mindcomplete?

Most AI tools force you to write complex prompts in a separate window. Mindcomplete works differently:
*   **Context-First:** Drop your moodboards, screenshots, and rough notes into a Figma section. Select it, and Mindcomplete will use that full context to write relevant copy.
*   **Visual Intelligence:** It reads text inside images and understands visual hierarchy, making it perfect for landing pages, social posts, and UI mockups.
*   **Flow State:** Just type a few words and the AI automatically picks up your tone and finishes your sentence, paragraph, or headline.

### ✨ Key Features

*   **Smart Autocomplete:** Generates text that fits your design's context perfectly.
*   **Image Analysis:** "Reads" images in your selection to inspire copy that matches your visuals.
*   **Writing Styles:** Switch instantly between **Storytelling**, **Professional**, **Social Media**, or define your own **Custom Style**.
*   **Seamless Integration:** Updates your text layers directly—no copy-pasting required.

### 🎮 How to use

1.  **Select** any layer, frame, or section in Figma.
2.  **Run** the Mindcomplete plugin.
3.  **Start writing** in the plugin window.
4.  **Pause** for a moment — the AI will automatically suggest a continuation.
5.  Select the part of the text you want to add to your writings, or press **Tab** to accept full suggestion.
6.  **Keep writing**.

### 💡 Use cases:

*   **Ideating:** The great way to expand on your ideas.
*   **Writing:** From articles to social media, you set up the context, and let your thoughts flow.
*   **Designing:** Fill your mockups with context-aware copy that fits the visual hierarchy instantly.
*   **Refining:** Quickly generate alternative headlines or body text to see what fits best with your design.
